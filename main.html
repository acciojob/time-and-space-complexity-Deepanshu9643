	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the computational time an algorithm takes to execute. It’s like keeping track of how many steps an algorithm performs as a function of the input size. Imagine you’re timing a chef preparing a recipe—the time it takes depends on the number of ingredients and the chef’s cooking speed. Similarly, an algorithm’s time complexity depends on the input size and the efficient of its execution.</p>
	<p>
<b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size. It includes both the memory needed for the variables and the data structures used within the algorithm. When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.
